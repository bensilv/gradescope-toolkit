# gradescope-toolkit
- This chrome extension was originally developed to assist with grading students in CS16 on gradescope. It highlighted specific areas in the autograder results and gave options to show only certain problems and tests.
- This extension no longer has a use since we have decided to add automatic rubric grading to the CS16 autograder, however I may one day turn it into something useful!
